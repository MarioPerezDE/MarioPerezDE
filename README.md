## 👋 About Me

I'm a Data Engineer with a strong foundation in data pipeline development, cloud platforms, and production-grade analytics. Recently, I completed my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin, where I specialized in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Optimization.

While my professional background centers on data engineering, I've actively expanded into machine learning through hands-on projects in computer vision (CNNs), time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet), and decision optimization (Gurobi, TensorFlow Decision Forests).

I'm now seeking opportunities to apply both my engineering rigor and machine learning knowledge to solve real-world business problems at scale.
